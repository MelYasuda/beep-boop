        <h3>How To Play</h3>
        <p>This website will give you all the numbers from 0 to the number you enter in the form.<br>
          Then, it will replace certain numbers with words like below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Numbers that contain a 0 are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"</li>
          <li>Numbers that contain a 1 are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"</li>
          <li>Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These exceptions are written from least to most important. <br>
          The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. <br>
          So, for example, in your finished program the number 10 should be replaced with "Boop!",<br>
           and the number 30 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."</p>
